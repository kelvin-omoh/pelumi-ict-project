     <br> The franchise also includes short films, a television series, live shows, video games and theme park attractions. It is distributed by Universal Pictures.
      The first film was released in 2001, which began the original tetralogy of films focused on illegal street racing and culminated in the film Fast & Furious (2009).
      
      The series transitioned towards heists and spying with Fast Five (2011) and was followed by five sequels, with the most recent, Fast X, set for release in 2023. An eleventh film is planned to conclude the series, and the main films are collectively known as The Fast Saga.
      
      Universal expanded the series to include the spin-off film Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019), while its subsidiary DreamWorks Animation followed this with the animated streaming television series Fast & Furious Spy Racers. Soundtrack albums have been released for all the films, as well as compilation albums containing existing music heard in the films. Two short films that tie into the series have also been released.
      
      The series has been commercially successful; Universal's biggest franchise, it is the seventh highest-grossing film series, with a combined gross of over $6 billion.[1] Critical reception for the first four films were mixed to negative until the fifth and later films, which were more mixed to positively received. Outside of the films, Fast & Furious has been the focus of other media, including attractions at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Florida, live shows, commercials, many video games and toys. It is considered the vehicle that propelled lead actors Vin Diesel and Paul Walker to stardom.[2]
